# 🌾 Climate Change Impact on Agriculture

This Power BI dashboard visualizes how key climate variables — such as temperature, CO₂ emissions, and extreme weather events — affect global agricultural productivity, crop yield, and economic losses. The goal is to help stakeholders understand the regional and temporal impacts of climate change on farming systems.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- 🌍 **Map View**: Explore average temperature or CO₂ emissions by country
- 📈 **Line Charts**: Analyze crop yield trends by year and crop type
- 🌾 **Scatter Plot**: Understand the relationship between temperature and yield
- ⚙️ **Farming Practices**: See how fertilizer and pesticide use affect yield
- 💰 **Economic Impact**: Visualize the cost of climate events by adaptation strategy
- 🧮 **KPI Cards**: Key stats including soil health, irrigation access, and more

## 🔍 Insights from the Dashboard

- 📉 Crop yield tends to decrease as temperature rises above 30°C
- 💧 Water management and crop rotation are effective adaptation strategies
- 🌱 High pesticide/fertilizer usage correlates with declining soil health
- 🌎 Tropical regions show highest variability in climate-induced economic impact
