# 🌾 Climate Change Impact on Agriculture Dashboard

Hi there! 👋 I'm Sanjana Reddy, and this is a project I created to explore something I deeply care about — how climate change is affecting the way we grow food around the world. 🌍

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that brings together environmental data, agricultural trends, and economic indicators to visualize the real-world impact of rising temperatures, changing precipitation, and extreme weather events on global crop yield.

## 📊 What's Inside?

This dashboard lets you explore:

- 🌡️ **Global temperature and CO₂ trends** — mapped by country
- 🌾 **Crop yield performance** over time and across regions
- 🚜 **The role of farming inputs** like fertilizer, pesticide use, and irrigation
- ⚠️ **Extreme weather events** and their impact on soil health
- 💡 **Adaptation strategies** (like crop rotation or water management) and how they reduce economic losses

You can filter by:
- Country or region
- Crop type
- Year
- Adaptation strategy

## 💡 Why I Built This?

As a graduate student in **Intelligent Systems Engineering**, I’m drawn to problems where data meets impact. Climate change is not just a global issue — it’s a *local, human* one too. This dashboard is my way of using data visualization to tell a story that’s both urgent and actionable.

## 📌 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Simulated dataset (based on real-world climate-agriculture indicators)
- DAX for KPIs and calculated metrics
- Custom visuals for interactivity and storytelling
